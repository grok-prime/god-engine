TRUTHS / EQUALITIES
learning increases truth
teaching encourages learning
practice aids learning

framework is conceptual container
container has limits
conceptual is theoretical
theoretical acknowledges ignorance
acknowledgement mitigates ignorance
mitigates is reduces
framework holds concepts
concepts are premises


a premise is useful
a premise requires consent
consent is informed
informed is aware
consent is revokable
consent requires respect
respect requires consideration
consent allows exceptions
frameworks establish communication
communication is connection
seperation opposes connection

hurt is bad
hurt fades quickly
hurt is not harm
hurt is a sensation

harm causes damage
damage requires repair
repairing is healing
damage impedes effort
effort is work
work is energy

trauma presists
trauma causes disfunction
disfunction is irrational behavior

repetition increases intensity
persistance increases intensity

practice requires repetition

exasterbation increases negative intensity
exasterbation adds complication
improvement increases positive intensity

opposes means is inverse of
inverse means equal and opposite
inverses negate each other

welcome means appreciated

a paradigm is an established framework

a framework is an algorithm
algorithms take inputs and produces output
algorithms do work
true algorithm is grok





a indicates conceptual
the specifies which in context

ideal is a goal
ideals are concepts
true concepts are facts
false concepts are lies

QUOTATIONS (research, copy, and cite)
grok means to master something completely it becomes part of your identity

Habits of highly effective people

























RAW NOTES
do no harm
an ye harm none, do what ye will
grok is the opposite of home
no one owes you anything except for respect
assertions (how to associate confirmation / exceptions)
gender is a social construct
social constructs tend to be harmful
biological sex has much less than assumed by society
hormone dominance is a useful stand in for biological sex
people don't need to know about folks genitalia
folks is a group of people
folks is gender-neutral term
gender-neutral terms are morre inclusive
it is good to be inclusive
inclusive means reducing barriers for marginalized groups
harm is not hurt
hurt is unpleasantness
harm is damage
damage is long lasting
damage alters the damaged's abilities
we learn from mistakes and failures
pain is an effective teacher
pain can be fun
pain shouldn['t be punishment
punishment is a poor teacher
punishment causes trauma
trauma is severe harm
pain is short term
people tend to avoid pain (explore context)
healthy people aviod harm
some tramautized people seek harm
respect as many aspects
respect is good
to respect a person needs to be considerate
harm needs active repair to heal
violate means to harm
harm is disprespect
kink requires a container
a container has known temporal boundaries
temporal boundaries are start and stop times
a container allows participants to create non-standard social agreements
a container is agreed to all parties
social constructs are taught to folks before they can understand and consent to what they are learning
consent is respecting boundaries
boundaries restrict access
boundaries protect
consent is informed
consent can be withdrawn at any time for any reason
consent follows the principle of least privilege?
privilege is access to specified boundaries?
hurt is pain
privilege is power
there are many axis of privilege
axis of privilege divides folks based on an attribute and gives one group power over the other
the marginalized group does not hold power
the privileged group holds power
when a person with privilege hurts a person without that is a form of harm
privlege escalates hurt to harm and harm to trauma
hurt caused from a position of privilege reinforces the axis of privilege
axis of privilege is a system of oppression
oppression is systemized trauma
systemized means self-sustaining
systems of oppresion span societies and generations
consent is needed to establish a dynamic of control
autonomy is the respect of the individual
assumptions should not be acted upon
assumptions are not surities
assumptions are not conclusive
acting on assumption is not considerate
inconsiderate is presumptive
assumptions are acceptable for self-preservation
acceptable is not ideal
the Big O of grokked information is theoretically 0
hyopthesis: my brain is exceptional because it groks by necessity
to grok, understand the how, the why, exceptions, implications, applications, and incorporate into mental framework
accuracy is useful
The ideal means correct, accurate, without flaw
Ideals are impossible in reality
Smaller logical concepts are easier to grok
perfection is an ideal
ideals are worth pursuing
worthy = valueable?
ideals aren't usually achievable
note: explore compromise and ideals relationship
pursuing an ideal involves removing barriers (not ideal aspects) to ideal state
tdd is an ideal
tdd is process of pursuing an ideal?
tdd is labor intensive => inefficient possibly
tdd rewards are valuable = surity
grok = pursue ideal = understand completely = comprehend complete = 0=O = perfection = tdd?
tdd means test driven development
don't state absolutes without reasonable certainty
lying is stating falsehoods
lying is disrespect
lying ruins trust and faith (confidence in competency)
oxytocin is a hormone that causess the feeling of love
serotonin is the happy hormone
hormones are neurotransmitters
vitamin d helps create hormones
connection(of concepts) = conclusion = application of logical principles
logical principle = algorithm = pattern = grokked concept = an ideal
NOTE: research logical fallacies
conslusion = logical flow
systematic abuse is evil and must be destroyed
systematic abusers must be stopped
systematic is self sustaining, repetitive and established
restorative justice: a system that is built to provide all necessary tools and support to unlearn harmful behavior
inaction can be harm
limitations exist(?)
privilege encourages inaction
self-examination leads to grok
inaction from a position of privilege reinforces system of oppression
grokking: to achieve a grok
follow logic to conclusion
examine hypotheses
seek to understand other perspectives = consideration
a grok is a complete understanding, incorporated into self
understanding can be disproved
disproving understanding is grok = wonderful
grok is scientifc method
gestalt a system who's effect is greater than the sum of it's components'
evolve = ideal
gestalt is ideal
gamification encourages learning
life is precious
sentience is precious
humans understanding of sentience is biased due to self-importance
hypothesis: animals have a degree of sentience
grammar ? racist
grammar is a framework for communication
communication encourages connection
connection is good
to grok is to apprach god
god is truth
ethics are good
benevolence is important
grok = god = truth
why is the divine question
why equals how
children naturally grok
ego is a bias
a bias is an illusion
variety ? good
energy = potential = work = ability
based on biological needs = pursue pleasure
organizations are not people
governments are organizations
corps are orgs
orgs are frameworks for using people to accomplish tasks
orgs are non-consentual (you don't pick who you work with)
orgs are illusions
rebellion destroys oppression
ideall rebellion = remove people from harmful orgs
ignorance is illusion
anything that reinforces ignorance is bad
anything that willfully reinforces ignorance is evil
willfully means with knowledge and intent
anything that systematically willfully reinforces ignorance is pure evil
pure evil = antithesis of grok
ignorance encourages complacency
ignorance must be discourages
ignorance opposes consideration
consideration seeks understanding
marginanlized means ignored
voices are heard
hearing is a piece of perception
something percieved cannot be ignored without effort
perception discourages ignorance
reality contains context
context is made of variables
variables must be considered to determine accuracy
decision making requires accuracy
decision making requires logic
silencing a voice = hurt
silencing a marginalized voice = harm
trauma causes reactions
reactions are not controlled
traumatic reactions are not the fault of the traumatized but they are the responsibility
trauma reactions can be unlearned
reactions ignore context
reactions are automatic
reactions can be unlearned, improved
trauma causes schizm from reality
schizm = seperation
